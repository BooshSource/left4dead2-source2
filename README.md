# left4dead2_imported_sbox

By the way, I won't be updating this repo often because I'm currently busy with a different project. 

This was made for s&box, but the assets can work in Half-Life Alyx. You have to replace all material shaders if your using these assets in Half-Life Alyx.

Most of the materials is not fixed for PBR. I will try to fix them over time.

The L4D2 particles mostly works in Half-Life Alyx, but not in s&box. Have to fix the particles manually for s&box.

I recommend to use list mode in the Asset broweser because some models will crash your game.

The survivor character models will crash your game!

Many of the assets will replace base Source 2 content. Please write a issue if your seeing some important assets getting overide. Animated Particle Textures, Tools and Editor Assets, etc.

If your using this repo for your project. Please credit me, Thanks.
