# left4dead2_imported_sbox

This was made for s&box, but the assets can work in Half-Life Alyx. You have to replace all material shaders if your using these assets in Half-Life Alyx.

Most of the materials is not fixed for PBR. I will try to fix them over time.

The survivor character models will crash your game!

If your using this repo for your project. Please credit me, Thanks.
