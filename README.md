# left4dead2_imported_sbox

This was made for s&box, but the assets can work in Half-Life Alyx. You have to replace all material shaders if your using these assets in Half-Life Alyx.

Most of the materials is not fixed for PBR. I will try to fix them over time.

I recommend to use list mode in the Asset broweser because some models will crash your game.

The survivor character models will crash your game!
